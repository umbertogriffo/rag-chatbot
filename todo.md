- System level safety:
  - https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-1B - https://huggingface.co/tensorblock/Llama-Guard-3-1B-GGUF
    - Llama Guard 3-1B is a fine-tuned Llama-3.2-1B pretrained model for content safety classification.
  - https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-8B
    - Llama Guard 3-8B is a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B pretrained model for content safety classification.
  - https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-11B-Vision
    - Llama Guard 3 Vision is a Llama-3.2-11B pretrained model, fine-tuned for content safety classification.
- Experiment Multimodal LLMs with `Llama 3.2 Vision 11B` (text + images in / text out)
  - The model is currently not supported by `llama.cpp` https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues/9643
  - Is it supported just by [(Ollama,](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) so we need to use the Python API to create an additional client.
    - https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python/tree/main
    - https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python/tree/main/examples
    - https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2-vision:11b
  - `Llama 3.2 Vision 11B` requires least `8GB` of `VRAM`, and the `90B` model requires at least `64GB` of `VRAM`.
